    <h1>Why I Love Web Development</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>It is opening doors to an industry I thought I'd never be a part of</li>
        <li>It helped me realize just how organized and clean I can be... just don't look at my room</li>
        <li>I'm finding a renewed sense of self by still being able to learn new things after my schooling in music!</li>
